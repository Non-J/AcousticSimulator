Making Copies of Save Data:
Save data are stored in "data.json" file, which should be next to the .exe file.
You may copy and keep them elsewhere. To load backup, place the file next to the .exe, rename it to "data.json", and reopen the program.
If the save data becomes corrupted, delete them and load from the backup, or reopen the program and let the program recreate a new save data.
