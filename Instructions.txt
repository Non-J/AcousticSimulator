Getting Started:

1) Extract zip file into a folder. (Important!)
2) Run "acoustic_simulator.exe".
4) Open the interface in web browser by using the URL "http://localhost:1200" (Without quotation marks)
5) There are further instructions inside the interface.


Making Copies of Save Data:
Save data are stored in "data.json" file, which should be next to the .exe file.
You may copy and keep them elsewhere. To load backup, place the file next to the .exe, rename it to "data.json", and reopen the program.
If the save data becomes corrupted, delete them and load from the backup, or reopen the program and let the program recreate a new save data.

Problem: "The system cannot find the path specified"
Solution:
	There is many cause for this error. Try the following:
	1) Make sure the files are extracted completely.
	2) Make sure the program has the permission to access the file. 
		Most likely Windows or antivirus software restricted the program from accessing the files.
	3) Windows has a bug where it cannot read files if the path is longer than 260 characters.
		Try to move the program folder to your Desktop and make sure your folder names are not too long.

	* VERY IMPORTANT. IF YOU IGNORE THIS, THE PROGRAM WILL NOT RUN !!! *
	4) EXTRACT THE FILE FROM THE ZIP FILE. DO NOT RUN THE PROGRAM DIRECTLY.
